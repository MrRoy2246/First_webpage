        <h2>Box Office</h2>
        <p>As of January 29, 2024, Tenet has grossed $58.5 million in the United States and Canada and $306.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.7 million.[2][1]

            With a production budget of $200 million,[116] it is Nolan's most expensive original project.[117] IndieWire speculated that marketing costs pushed the final sum to $300–350 million,[118] though some analysts predicted it would incur lower advertising costs than usual, owing to inexpensive live sports ads.[119] Box office analyst Jeff Bock estimated the film would need to make $400–500 million to break even.[120] In November 2020, rival studios expected the film to lose up to $100 million, but Warner Bros. insisted losses would not top $50 million.[121] Nolan reportedly received twenty percent of the film's first-dollar gross.[122]</p>
